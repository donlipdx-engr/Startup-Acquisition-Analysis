## Introduction

According to [KPMG](https://kpmg.com/xx/en/media/press-releases/2025/01/2024-global-vc-investment-rises-to-368-billion-dollars.html#:~:text=Enterprise's%20Venture%20Pulse-,2024%20global%20VC%20investment%20rises%20to%20%24368%20billion%20as%20investor,KPMG%20Private%20Enterprise's%20Venture%20Pulse), global venture capital (VC) investments totaled almost $369 billion for 2024 alone. With both so much uncertainty regarding the future success (or failure) of a given startup and the sheer investment capital at-stake, it is critical for VC firms, for both investment success and risk management, to be able to gauge the likelihood of a startup succeeding. VC firms often gravitate towards investing in tech startups due to the higher scalability of a tech startup's products/services.
